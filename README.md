### Dev Notes
- Using bootstrap v4

### Next Features
- Consider lodash for sorting/Filtering
- The way the default sort is being stored does not play as nicely as I'd like with filtering. So when choosing that sort I'm just removing any filters
- Don't use hard indexes for displaying appropriate columns
- Better Performance of filtering
